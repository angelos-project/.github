# Mission
**Angelos Project™** aims to design and build an open-source, distributed communication platform for Christian believers,
assemblies, and ministries. The goal is to provide a secure and sovereign alternative to centralized services by enabling 
private communication, authenticated identity, and resilient infrastructure under the direct control of its users.

The project’s objective is the development of a **distributed server platform** combined with a **secure application for mobile 
and desktop environments**. Together, these components are intended to support encrypted messaging, document exchange, and 
community coordination across independently operated nodes, without reliance on third-party platforms or locked-in providers.

Angelos Project™ focuses on privacy by design, strong cryptography, peer-verified identity, and decentralized trust. All 
systems are being developed openly and incrementally, with emphasis on correctness, auditability, and long-term maintainability. 
The software is not yet complete; protocols, services, and applications are actively under development.

The goal of Angelos Project™ is to equip Christian assemblies with practical, secure digital infrastructure that can support 
fellowship and ministry in environments where surveillance, censorship, or platform dependency pose increasing threats.
