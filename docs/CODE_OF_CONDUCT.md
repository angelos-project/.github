# Angelos Project™ Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
  

## Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or religious attacks on christians and jewish alike

* Public or private harassment

* Disruptive behavior

* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to actions taken outside of these spaces, and which have a negative impact on community health.


## Enforcement and Reporting

We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement in the given project or by the founder himself. Or by the founder publicly appointed angelos foundation appropriately delegated to do so.


## Responsible Use of AI-Generated Content

We are excited about the innovation and the opportunities that generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot bring to our community. It's essential to use these technologies thoughtfully and in alignment with our shared values of integrity, respect, and authenticity.

When using generative AI to contribute to the community:

* **Take ownership of your contributions**. You are responsible for the content you share.  
* **Review and revise AI-generated responses before posting**. Ensure they reflect your own understanding and voice.  
* **Apply your expertise** to validate that the information is accurate, relevant, and helpful.

These practices support a community built on trust, collaboration, and mutual respect. Misuse of AI-generated content may be considered a violation of our Code of Conduct. Please refer to the enforcement section for more details.
