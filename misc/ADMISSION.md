Our Purpose

**Purpose**. The purpose hereof is primarily to enable the liberty and integrity for believing bodies of persons of judeo-christian heritage residing throughout the world where the protections of such freedoms are *de facto* inadequate no matter *de jure*, in the digital network era. Secondly, to provide a technical platform enabling secure independent solutions in the digital realm for benevolent NGO:s and entities throughout the world to be used for good.

**Protection**. **You**, the “Community member” or “Contributor,” accepts to license and sublicense under an already appointed open source license which is i) short, ii) highly liberal, and iii) approved by the *open source initiative*. **You** also agree with the terms of the *Developer Certificate of Origin* – hosted at [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) – in relation to this document. No trademark or patent rights held by the **Owner** or **Author** are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. Further the **Owner** or **Author** offers the Work (source and binary code) as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. Also the **Owner** or **Author** further disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's copyright and related or neighboring rights in the Work. Also, the **Owner** or **Author** disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.

**Loyalty**. This means that **You**: stay loyal to the purpose, mission and protection of the Project as a Community member, Contributor and in additional roles dealing directly with the Project.  Also, **You** will not make statements in the name of the Project or represent it except explicitly told so and accepting of such role. **You** also promise to do your best to follow policy guidelines and other information for your, mine and the best of others. Explicitly **You** promise to do your best to produce high quality code that is considered safe, free from bugs and a clear conscience regarding malignant or covert introduction of loopholes in the Project and secret backdoors or other such devices in the Work thereof for the protection of everyone’s public safety and risk of damage. As well as public harm to the Project, and its standing reputation, also not to purposefully harm the trademark associated with the Project. Failing to do so is seen as a breach of Loyalty and leads to disbandment of any further cooperation or association as a Contributor or any other role in the Project. Grace for breach of Loyalty can be applied if coercion happened and viable evidence can be properly presented and examined.

**Malice**. Hidden or open malice against the Project, the Body of Christ, Israel or fellow citizens thereof is considered a breach of Loyalty. That which counts as malice, is patriotism against aforementioned bodies – including persons and groups thereof – including such conduct against it/them.
